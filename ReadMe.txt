== Description ==

Socializer! is a low resources easy to use free plugin to have your posts shared on top social networking sites, including Facebook (both "share" and "like" are supported), Google Plus, by eMail...  Socializer! won't make your blog heavier, it will let your server work without additional burdens, because it loads only one image -- not the images of all the sites it can submit your posts to, nor lengthy scripts.

After you activate the plugin you will find on your Wordpress admin pages its options, letting you choose what to share with Socializer! -- posts or pages, or both posts and pages.

When a user clicks on the Socializer! button, a control panel on Socializer's server opens with options to share your post even on several bookmarking and social sites simultaneously, eMail it to a friend, recommend it with Google plus.
