Socializer! is a low resources easy to use free plugin to have your posts shared on facebook and top social networks, Google Plus, by eMail...

== Description ==

With the free Socializer! plugin you can have your posts shared on the top social networks, including Facebook (both "share" and "like" are supported), promoted with Google Plus, recommended by eMail, keeping your pages speedy. Socializer! loads just a 6 K animated image -- not the images of all the sites it can submit your posts to, nor lengthy scripts. When a user clicks on the Socializer! button, a clean and pleasant control panel in a new window offers options for sharing on top social and bookmarking sites, eMailing to friends, suggesting with Google plus. 

Socializer! will let you choose what to share -- posts or pages, or both posts and pages, place the share button at the top of your content, or at the bottom, or at both the top and the bottom. Alternatively or along with this button, you can use the Socializer! Widget, letting you share from your sidebar(s) each and every page of your blog.

Socializer! will also let you use css styles to customize the position, alignment etc, of both the content and the widget buttons - even replace the default Socializer! buttons with custom ones of your own! It will also let you create manually occasional, sporadic, share-links independently of the regular buttons.

Note: If you have also a non-Wordpress php site, or asp, simple html etc, you may like to check the [Socializer! Javascript Edition](http://www.thefreewindows.com/5641/socializer-javascript/)
