A fast plugin for sharing on top social networks, by eMail, making HTML links and translations, helping explore your site and Follow, giving short links...


== Description ==

Socializer! helps your visitors to share your blog on the top social networks, including Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, by eMail (including gMail), even translate them to their language, get short links, get HTML Reference and Share links, explore your blog more, even Follow you..., *without compromising the speed of your pages*. You can see Socializer! in action, e.g. at [Live Desktop Gadgets](http://windowslivegadgets.com/gallery/)

Note that Socializer! won't *urge* your visitors to share your pages, it relies on their own spontaneous decision. If you want to *require* the sharing of your site, you can use [Social Share Motivator](http://www.thefreewindows.com/15816/reveal-posts-visitors-share-social-networks/)

**Socializer! is self-dependent and safe:** it does not interact with your database, and it keeps your blog speedy, since it loads immediately scripts for the popular share options (Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus), postponing the rest for users who actually need them. 

Alternatively or along with content buttons, you can use the convenient and **global** Socializer! FLOATING Widget, a **vertical social bar** that remains visible all the time, no matter how long your pages are, on a fixed location you can define with absolute precision. Normal Sidebar Widgets are also available. 

You can use simple css directions to customize and fine tune the position, alignment, background, borders, etc, of the content and widget buttons according to your needs.

You have options to decide what to share, posts or pages, or both posts and pages, place social icons at the top of your content or at the bottom, or in both locations. Sharing buttons can appear also on Archives (Categories, Tags, Dates, etc), although this would be overwhelming for your visitors and is not recommended.

Socializer! share bars can be invoked also by using the **[SocializerNow]** shortcode anywhere you like. You can also create manually [occasional share-links](http://www.thefreewindows.com/11487/incorporating-socializer-web-scripts-software-creating-manual-sharelinks/) independently of the regular buttons, in case that you need to use such references in some article.

Socializer! supports the option to **hide the counts** in icons that appear immediately on your pages, an option which can be very useful, if you don't want your visitors to see immediately how many times a post or page is shared, or even if you just need smaller versions of the sharing bars and widgets. 

Socializer! supports also **automatic detection of mobile phones**, in which case it lets you decide if you want to hide the floating social bar automatically. To use this feature you need to adjust your caching plugin (if you use any) to serve dynamic content to mobiles.

If you have a personal, business or fan page in Facebook, Twitter or Google Plus, you can have Socializer! adding a **Follow** button among the share buttons. [See live how Follow works](http://windowslivegadgets.com/gallery/)
