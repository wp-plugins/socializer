Socializer! is a low resources easy to use free plugin to have your posts shared on top social networking sites, Google Plus, by eMail...

== Description ==

Socializer! will not add to your blog’s weight, it will let your server work without additional burdens, because it loads only one image – not the images of all the sites it can submit your posts to, nor lengthy scripts.

After you activate the plugin you will find on your WordPress admin pages its options, letting you choose what to share with Socializer! — posts or pages or both posts and pages.

When a user clicks on the Socializer! button, a control panel on the server of Socializer opens with options to share your post even on several bookmarking and social sites simultaneously. You can share this very post to see a live demo of the Socializer! control panel.
