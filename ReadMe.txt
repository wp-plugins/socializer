Socializer! is a fast plugin for sharing on Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, and more social networks, by eMail, translating posts, getting html links, exploring a site, getting short links...


== Description ==

Socializer! helps your visitors to share your blog on more than 30 top social networks, including Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, by eMail, even translate them to their language, get short links, get html reference and share links, explore your blog more using Google search results.., without compromising the speed of your pages. You can see Socializer! in action, e.g. at [Live Desktop Gadgets](http://windowslivegadgets.com/gallery/)

Socializer! won't urge your visitors to share your pages, it relies on their own spontaneous decision. If you want to require the sharing of your site, you can use it along with [Social Share Motivator](http://www.thefreewindows.com/15816/reveal-posts-visitors-share-social-networks/), a plugin that pops up a Share prompt.

Socializer! is self-dependent and safe: it does not interact with your database, and it keeps your blog speedy, since it loads immediately only scripts for the most popular share options (Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus), postponing the rest for users who actually need them. 

Alternatively or along with content buttons, you can use the convenient and global Socializer! Widget and / or FLOATING Widget, that remains visible all the time, no matter how long your pages are, on a fixed location you can define with absolute precision. You can use simple CSS directions to customize and fine tune the position, alignment, background, borders, etc, of content and widget buttons according to your needs.

You have options to decide what to share, posts or pages, or both posts and pages, place social buttons at the top of your content or at the bottom, or in both locations. Sharing buttons can appear also on Archives (Categories, Tags, Dates, etc), although this would be overwhelming for visitors and is not recommended.

Socializer! share buttons can be invoked even by using the [SocializerNow] shortcode anywhere you wish. It lets you also [create manually occasional / sporadic share-links](http://www.thefreewindows.com/11487/incorporating-socializer-web-scripts-software-creating-manual-sharelinks/) independently of the regular buttons, in case that you need to use specific sharing references in some article.

Socializer! supports the option to hide share Counts in the (Facebook, Twitter and Google Plus) icons that appear immediately on your pages, an option which can be very useful, if you don't want your visitors to see immediately how many times a post or page is shared, or even if you just need smaller sharing buttons.

Socializer! is compatible with WordPress multisite MS / MU installations. 

Social networks supported (and more options): Facebook, Twitter, Google Bookmarks and Google Plus, Reddit, eMail recommendation, Google Translate, copying raw HTML Code (href) for Links and Share Links, getting Short URL versions with TinyURL, share in BlinkList, BlogMarks, Del.Icio.Us, Digg, Evernote, FormSpring, FriendFeed, Linkedin, LiveJournal, Chime, MySpace, Pinterest, StumbleUpon, Technorati, Connotea, DotNetKicks, DZone,  Fark, Faves, LinkArena, LinkaGoGo, MisterWong, N4G, NewsVine, Netvouz, NuJIJ, Scoopeo, Tipd, Tumblr, Xerpi.

== Installation ==

To install Socializer! follow the usual way of installing WordPress plugins: unzip the archive and upload the "socializer" folder inside the plugins folder of your blog, then activate Socializer! and configure it. 

Content, Shortcode, Simple and Floating Widget buttons are all configured from the Socializer! admin page at the Settings section of your blog, and can be styled further even by your main style sheet.

For WordPress multisite MS / MU installations you can activate the Socializer! globally, for all the sites of your network, or just install it on the main (network admin) site, leave it deactivated there, and activate it on (any number of) individual blogs in your network.
