Socializer! is a low resources free plugin to share your posts on Facebook, Twitter and more top social networks, Google Plus, by eMail...

== Description ==

With the free Socializer! plugin you can have your posts shared on more than 30 (top only) social networks, including Facebook (both "share" and "like" are supported) and Twitter, have them promoted in Google Plus, recommended by eMail... - always keeping your pages speedy, since Socializer! loads just a 6 K animated image -- not the images of all the sites it can submit your posts to, nor lengthy scripts. This way your web site will stay fast, letting your visitors enjoy the content. 

Socializer! is absolutely self-dependent; it won't change anything in your database.

When a user clicks on the Socializer! button, a clean and pleasant control panel in a new window offers sharing options. Socializer! supports (in order of appearance): HTML Code (href) for Link and Share Link, Google and Google Plus submission, Reddit, Twitter, Facebook (“Share” and “Like”), eMail recommendation, BlinkList, BlogMarks, Del.Icio.Us, Digg, Fark, FriendFeed, Linkedin, Mixx, MySpace, StumbleUpon, Technorati, YahooMyWeb. And (second layer, appearing on demand): Co.mments, Connotea, DotNetKicks, DZone, Faves, LinkArena, LinkaGoGo, MisterWong, N4G, NewsVine, Netvouz, NuJIJ, Scoopeo, Sphinn, Tipd, Tumblr, Wikio, Xerpi.

Socializer! will let you choose what to share -- posts or pages, or both posts and pages, place the share button at the top of your content, or at the bottom, or in both locations. The Socializer! sharing button can appear in individual posts and pages, and also on Archives (Categories, Tags, Dates, Home/Index pages).

Alternatively or along with this button, you can use the Socializer! Widget, letting you share from your sidebar(s) each and every page of your blog.

Socializer! will also let you use css styles to customize the position, alignment etc, of both the content and the widget buttons - even completely replace the Socializer! buttons with custom ones of your own! It will also let you create manually occasional, sporadic, share-links independently of the regular buttons.

The plugin works perfectly with WordPress multisite MS / MU installations too. 

* Note that if you have also a non-Wordpress php site, or asp, simple html etc, there is a [Javascript Edition of Socializer!](http://www.thefreewindows.com/5641/socializer-javascript/)

== Installation ==

To install Socializer! follow the usual way of installing Wordpress plugins: unzip the archive and upload the "socializer" folder inside the plugins folder of your blog, then activate Socializer! and configure it. Both content and widget options are configured from the Socializer! admin page at the Settings section of your blog.

For WordPress multisite MS / MU installations you can activate the Socializer! globally, for all the sites of your network, or just install it on the main (network admin) site, leave it deactivated there, and activate it on (any number of) individual sites in your network.

You can also create occasional share-links manually, if you need to, when you write a page or post and make references to some other post or page. Read instructions for this at [Socializer! Downloads](http://www.thefreewindows.com/5598/socializer-share-Wordpress-posts-pages/)
