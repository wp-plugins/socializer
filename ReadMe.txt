Socializer! is an extremely fast plugin to share posts on Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, Reddit and top social networks, by eMail, translate them...


== Description ==

Socializer! helps your visitors share your posts on more than 30 top social networks, including Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, Reddit, by eMail, even translate them to their language, get short links, get html and share links, explore your site even more in Google search results!.., all of this without compromising the speed of your pages even a little. You can see Socializer! live in action, e.g. at [TheFreeWindows](http://www.thefreewindows.com/)

Note that Socializer won't urge your visitors to share your pages, it relies on their own spontaneous decision. If you want to require the sharing of your site, you can use Socializer! along with [Social Share Motivator](http://www.thefreewindows.com/15816/reveal-posts-visitors-share-social-networks/), a plugin that pops up a Share prompt.

Socializer! keeps your pages light and fast, because it loads a single image, it does not run lengthy scripts, etc. The plugin is absolutely self-dependent and safe: it won't change anything in your database, it won't even connect to your database for any reason whatever.

When a user clicks on the Socializer! button, a clean and pleasant control panel in a new window offers sharing and translation options, even an option to explore your site more using Google indexes. Socializer! keeps sharing easy, supporting prestigious popular social sites, such as Facebook, Reddit, Google Plus and Twitter, offering thus a simple and most convenient submission panel. 

You can decide what to be shared - posts or pages, or both posts and pages, place the share button at the top of your content or at the bottom, or in both locations. The Socializer! sharing button can appear also on Archives (Categories, Tags, Dates, Home/Index pages). 

Alternatively or along with this button, you can use the Socializer! Widget and / or a special FLOATING Share Widget, that remains visible all the time, no matter how long your pages are, on a fixed location you can define.

The default Socializer! buttons / images can be replaced with any image whatever you may like, just by pasting its url in the relevant option of the plugin's settings. You can easily use simple CSS directions to customize and fine tune the position, alignment etc, of the content and widget buttons according to your theme needs, using the settings page of the plugin, or / and your main style sheet.

Socializer! will also let you [create manually occasional / sporadic share-links](http://www.thefreewindows.com/11487/incorporating-socializer-web-scripts-software-creating-manual-sharelinks/) independently of the regular buttons, in case you need to use in your article specific share links to other pages of your site or of other sites.

Social networks supported (and more options): Facebook, Twitter, Google Bookmarks and Google Plus, Reddit, eMail recommendation, Google Translate, copying raw HTML Code (href) for Links and Share Links, getting Short URL versions with TinyURL, share in BlinkList, BlogMarks, Del.Icio.Us, Digg, Evernote, FormSpring, FriendFeed, Linkedin, LiveJournal, Chime, MySpace, Pinterest, StumbleUpon, Technorati, Connotea, DotNetKicks, DZone,  Fark, Faves, LinkArena, LinkaGoGo, MisterWong, N4G, NewsVine, Netvouz, NuJIJ, Scoopeo, Tipd, Tumblr, Xerpi.

== Installation ==

To install Socializer! follow the usual way of installing WordPress plugins: unzip the archive and upload the "socializer" folder inside the plugins folder of your blog, then activate Socializer! and configure it. 

Both content and widget options are configured from the Socializer! admin page at the Settings section of your blog.

For WordPress multisite MS / MU installations you can activate the Socializer! globally, for all the sites of your network, or just install it on the main (network admin) site, leave it deactivated there, and activate it on (any number of) individual sites in your network.

You can also create occasional share-links manually, if you need to, when you write a page or post and make references to some other post or page. Read instructions for this at [manual Socializer!](http://www.thefreewindows.com/11487/incorporating-socializer-web-scripts-software-creating-manual-sharelinks/)
