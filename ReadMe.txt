A fast plugin for sharing on top social networks, eMail, making HTML links, short links, translations, helping explore your site & Follow you...


== Description ==

Socializer! helps your visitors to share your blog on the top social networks, including Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, by eMail (including gMail), even translate your pages, get short links, get HTML Reference links and Share links in order to use them on their sites or share them with their friends and in forums, explore your blog even more, Follow you on Facebook, Twitter and Gooble Plus..., all of this *without compromising the speed of your pages*. You can see Socializer! in action, e.g. at [Live Desktop Gadgets](http://windowslivegadgets.com/gallery/)

**Socializer! is self-dependent and safe:** it does not interact with your database, and it keeps your blog speedy, since it loads immediately scripts for the popular share options (Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus), postponing other options for users who actually need them. 

Alternatively or along with content share bars, especially useful in responsive designs, you can use the global Socializer! FLOATING icons, a *vertical social bar* that remains visible all the time, no matter how long a page might be, on a fixed location you can define with precision. Normal Sidebar widgets are also available.

You can use simple CSS directions to customize and fine tune the position, alignment, colors, borders, etc, of the Share bars and widgets according to your needs. If you are not familiar with CSS or just prefer a preview of your settings before you apply them, you can use the convenient On Line [Socializer! Style Editor](http://www.thefreewindows.com/socializer-style-editor/index.php), a free tool, accessible from the Socializer! settings page in your dashboard.

Socializer! includes options on what to share, posts or pages, or both posts and pages, place Share bars at the top of your content or at the bottom, or in both locations. Sharing bars can appear also on Archives (Categories, Tags, Dates, etc), although this would be overwhelming for your visitors and is not recommended.

Socializer! Share bars can be invoked also by using the **[SocializerNow]** Shortcode anywhere you like, adding flexibility you may need especially in responsive themes. 

You can also create manually [occasional share-links](http://www.thefreewindows.com/11487/incorporating-socializer-web-scripts-software-creating-manual-sharelinks/) independently of the regular buttons, whenever you need to have such references in some articles.

Socializer! supports the option of **hiding the counts** in icons that appear immediately on your pages, an option which can be very useful, when you don't want your visitors to see immediately how many times a post or page is shared, or even if you just need smaller versions of the Sharing bars. 

Socializer! supports also **automatic detection of mobile phones**, in which case it lets you decide if you want to hide the Floating bar automatically (your caching plugin must also support this function).

If you have a personal, business or fan page in Facebook, Twitter or Google Plus, you can let Socializer! add a **Follow** button in the Share bars. You can [see live how Follow works](http://windowslivegadgets.com/gallery/)
