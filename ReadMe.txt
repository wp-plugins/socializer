Socializer! is a low resources easy to use free plugin to have your posts shared on facebook and top social networks, Google Plus, by eMail...

== Description ==

Socializer! is a low resources easy to use free plugin to have your posts shared on the top social networks, including Facebook (both "share" and "like" are supported), promoted with Google Plus, recommended by eMail...  

Socializer! keeps your server light and speedy since it loads just a 6 K animated image at the end of your post and/or page content -- not the images of all the sites it can submit your posts to, nor lengthy scripts.

When a user clicks on the Socializer! animated button, a control panel in a new window offers share options for several social and bookmarking sites, eMailing to friends, recommendation with Google plus. 

After activation you will find on your Wordpress admin pages the options of Socializer!, letting you choose what to share -- posts or pages, or both posts and pages. 

Alternatively, you can use the Socializer! Widget (activated separately). The widget will let you share each and every page of your blog, and it can be placed wherever a widget can appear according to the theme that you use.

== Installation ==

To install the plugin follow the usual way of installing new Wordpress plugins: unzip the archive and upload the "socializer" folder inside the plugins folder of your blog. Activate the main plugin or the widget or both. 

The main plugin is configured from a Socializer! page at the Settings section of your blog. The widget can be added to your sidebar from the Appearance/Widgets menu, without needing any further configuration. 

You can also create share-links manually, if you need to, when you write a page or post and make references to some other post or page. Instructions for manual creation of share-links you will find at the Settings page of Socializer! when you activate it, or right now at the [Home Page of Socializer!](http://www.thefreewindows.com/5598/socializer-share-Wordpress-posts-pages/)
