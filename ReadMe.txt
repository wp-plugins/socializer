== Description ==

Socializer! is a low resources easy to use free plugin to have your posts shared on top social networking sites, including Facebook (both "share" and "like" are supported), Google Plus, by eMail...  Socializer! won't make your blog heavier, since it loads a nice and single 5 K animated image -- not the images of all the sites it can submit your posts to, nor lengthy scripts.

When a user clicks on the Socializer! animated button, a control panel on Socializer's server opens in a new window, with options to share your post on several bookmarking and social sites even simultaneously, eMail it to a friend, recommend it with Google plus. 

This way the benefit for your visitors will be great too, since they will be given the opportunity to take their time and share your post on several sites, which is impossible when sharing-links appear on popups, etc. Your blog will remain clean from an overload of sharing images, your server light and speedy, your visitors happy, your posts shared more than any other solution permits.

After you activate the plugin you will find on your Wordpress admin pages its options, letting you choose what to share with Socializer! -- posts or pages, or both posts and pages. Alternatively, you can use the Widget of Socializer! 

The widget will let you share each and every page of your blog, and it can be placed wherever a widget can appear. It doesn't need any configuration: just activate it at the Settings/plugins page, add it to your sidebar at the Appearance/Widgets page, and enjoy!

Besides these options, you can also create sharing-links manually, if you need to, when you write a page or post and make references to some other post or page. Instructions for the manual creation of sharing-links you can find at the Settings page of Socializer! at your own blog, or right now on the [Home Page of Socializer!](http://www.thefreewindows.com/5598/socializer-share-Wordpress-posts-pages/)
